## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate and self-driven .NET backend developer focused on building **production-grade APIs** and **scalable backend systems** that follow **clean architecture, DDD, and SOLID principles**.

My goal is simple: **build software that matters — not toy projects, but systems that can be used globally** and meet real-world enterprise needs.
